a^2 + b^2 = c^2

Here, the response vector $Y$ is \mybold{qualitative}.

$\mathcal{Y} = \{\texttt{spam},  \texttt{ham}\}$ (\texttt{ham}=correct e-mail) or $\mathcal{Y}= \{0, 1, \dots,9\}$.

The objective could be
\begin{itemize}
	\item create a classifier $\phi(x)$ that maps $x$ to one of the classes in $\mathcal{Y}$
	\item evaluate the classification incertitude \footfullcite{Massias_Gramfort_Salmon18}\footfullcite{Dalalyan_Tsybakov07}

	\end{equation*}
	for the loss  $l(y,y')=1_{y\neq y'}$.

	\vspace{1cm}

	One can always use  $\widehat{\phi}(x)$.

	And a common issue is not using the percentage symbol ($\%$) enough !
