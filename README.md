## REML
The REML is the Restricted Maximum Likelihood  
When we calculate the Maximum Likelihood, we obtain a biased variance estimator. Thanks to the REML, the estimator of the variance is unbiased.  
The principle is : if the log-likelihood has any informations about the mean, we can optimize it and obtain an unbiased variance estimator.
